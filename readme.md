# Cat Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements machine learning models to classify images containing Lacta, Karamela, or both cats. The system addresses challenges like class imbalance, visual complexity, and limited training data through a systematic approach including baseline CNNs, transfer learning, and Bayesian optimization.

## Quick Start (View Only)
**No installation required!** You can read all notebooks directly on GitHub:
- Simply open any `.ipynb` file in the `notebooks` folder
- GitHub will render the notebooks with all code, markdown, and outputs visible
- Perfect for reviewing methodology and results without running code

## Full Setup (Interactive Execution)

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raumfahrer007/cat_classifier.git
cd cat-classifier
```
### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook
```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```
### 3. Download Project Assets
From Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rt7a59YWzPHRuB3BATFKmCIZ0MHnRrpD?usp=sharing
- Download the models/ folder and place it in the project root
- Download the raw/ folder and place it inside data/

Final structure should be:

text
cat_classifier/  
├── models/           # ← Download from Google Drive  
├── data/  
│   └── raw/         # ← Download from Google Drive  
├── notebooks/  
├── src/  
└── ...
### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
### 5. Execute Notebooks in Order
Notebook 1: 01_data_exploration_and_preparation
- Run all cells to split raw data into train/val/test sets
- This creates the structured dataset for training

Notebook 2: 02_machine_learning
- Run all cells EXCEPT training cells (models already provided)
- Execute evaluation cells to reproduce results and analyses
- Explore the pre-trained models and their performance

## Important Notes
- Training is optional: All trained models are included in the downloaded models/ folder
- Data privacy: The raw images are provided separately via Google Drive
